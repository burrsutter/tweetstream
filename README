Twitter4j Config
----------------
Everything is setup and configured for twitter4j except the API 
credentials.  We can not provide public credentials for accessing 
twitter API's via twitter4j.  This mean you will need to get and 
create your own credentials following the twitter4j and twitter 
instructions.

This is really not too hard, but does require some effort.  Because 
these steps change from time to time you should see 
http://twitter4j.org/en/configuration.html and 
https://dev.twitter.com/pages/auth for the details.

Once you have access to the values here: 

oauth.consumerKey=**************************
oauth.consumerSecret=**************************
oauth.accessToken=**************************
oauth.accessTokenSecret=**************************

Update tweetstream/src/main/resources/twitter4j.properties with these 
values.  From there you should be able to build and run the application.
